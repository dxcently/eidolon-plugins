# ack-failure.sh: what the *process* does when the store cannot be written after a
# send has already been handed over — the case a unit test can only describe.
#
# The stand-in `eidolon` makes the store's directory unwritable as it answers the
# send, and only then: the scan's write-ahead write has already succeeded, the notice
# has gone out, and the acknowledgement cannot be written. The live process then holds
# an answer the file does not, which is exactly the state that must not be served.

#     bash tests/coordinator/ack-failure.sh
#
# What it measures: the process says why and **exits non-zero**, and the file it left
# behind still holds the notice as `pending` under the same `notice_id`.
#
# What it does NOT measure: that a restart then retries it. No second monitor process is
# started against that store. The retry-after-reload half is the unit test
# `a_crash_after_the_send_and_before_the_ack_repeats_the_same_id` — a fresh store loaded
# from the file attempts the same id again, word for word — and the real process restart
# *and* retry is unverified.
