#
# It starts its own worker session (which hits its iteration wall and stays alive at
# `stuck`), its own coordinator session (a live recipient), and the monitor on its own
# port and store root. Then, against ONE stuck worker and therefore one occurrence:
#
#   1. adopts through the **service API** with a caller this script supplies;
#   2. adopts through the **plugin's tool**, driven by `eidolon workflow run`, where
#      `coordinator_adopt` reads its own `me` row — the caller is that run's minted
#      session id, and the check below compares the record against the id the harness
#      itself reported for the run;
#   3. checks that the one occurrence produced **two notices with two ids, one addressed
#      to each recipient**, and that releasing the first coordinator left the second's
#      notice and record alone.
#
# Every claim here is load-bearing: it is one assertion inside `verify`, which exits
# non-zero when any of them is false, and the script then runs `verify` twice more with
# deliberately wrong inputs and requires it to FAIL. A check that cannot fail is not
# evidence, so the injections are the proof that these can.
#
# This is a live fixture: it needs a real binary and it starts real sessions of its own
# under a throwaway HOME. Nothing installed, no vault, no operator session.
