# the distinction the review asked for, at the service level rather than in a unit
# test. A stand-in `eidolon` whose `peers --json` fails must make `adopt` *refuse
# before anything is written*, and say that the roster was unreadable rather than
# that no live session carries the address. Those are different facts and a reader
# must not have to guess which one happened.
