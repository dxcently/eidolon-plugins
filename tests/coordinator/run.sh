# Two things are checked, and they are different kinds of evidence.
#
# (1) The monitor, end to end, against a stand-in harness: a fake `eidolon`
#     answers `peers --json` from a fixture file and answers `send --json` with
#     the harness's typed outcome. The real service binary is started on a port of
#     its own with its own state root, and its four doors are driven with curl.
#     This is the whole plumbing — adoption, one notice per occurrence, no repeat,
#     the errored-ending fallback and its stated limit, release, and the typed
#     outcome stored as given. It is NOT evidence about the harness: the rows are a
#     fixture.
#
# (2) The shipped bytes fail closed. The plugin is installed into a throwaway
#     config and a workflow calls `coordinator_adoptions` against the real harness:
#     the refusal must name what the harness does not publish for this session
#     rather than answer as if nobody had been adopted.
