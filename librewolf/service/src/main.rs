//! `eidolon-librewolf` — the librewolf bridge host. The README in `../` is the
//! whole picture; this file is the process.
//!
//! Two faces, one process:
//!
//! * the **native messaging host** LibreWolf spawns, because the extension's
//!   host manifest names this binary and stdio is the channel; and
//! * the **loopback endpoint** the `librewolf_*` tools dial, on
//!   127.0.0.1:$EIDOLON_LIBREWOLF_PORT (8091) with a Bearer token, `/health`
//!   and `/call` in the same shapes as `eidolon-browser`.
//!
//! There is deliberately no `service:` block in `plugin.rn`: the process that
//! has to be running is the one the browser starts, and `eidolon plugins
//! service start` cannot start a browser. The token, the `api_request`
//! endpoint and the "answers with the reason it isn't there" error are the
//! primitives that *are* reused. See the README's Prerequisites.
//!
//! Nothing here writes to stdout except native messages: a stray `println!`
//! would be read by the extension as a length prefix and desynchronize the
//! channel. Diagnostics go to stderr, which the browser collects into its
//! console.

/// Diagnostics go to stderr — the browser collects it into its console, and it
/// becomes a broken pipe the instant the browser dies. `eprintln!` *panics* on a
/// broken pipe, which would kill the very thread that is shutting this host down;
/// that is exactly how a host came to outlive its browser and keep answering the
/// tools about a session that was gone. So nothing here uses `eprintln!`.
