    description = "The driver host a session dials to run a turn on an external CLI";
    longDescription = ''
      The half of the driver that runs beside the session and owns the external
      CLI. It binds a private unix socket at $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/eidolon-claude.sock
      and speaks one length-prefixed JSON frame at a time: hello, run_turn,
      cancel, and the events, session mark, usage and settle that come back.

      `eidolon-claude --real --cli <path>` spawns that CLI, translates its
      stream-json into those frames, and serves the two doors it needs to reach
      the harness's gate: a pre-tool hook in own-tools mode, and an MCP server in
      registry mode. Without `--real` it runs a fake backend that scripts a turn,
      which is what the session half is tested against. It reads no credential
      and reaches no network of its own.
