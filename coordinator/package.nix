# It is the process the plugin's `service:` block declares: the one that holds the
# adoption records, watches the workers that were adopted, and sends one notice
# per observed halt. `eidolon plugins service start coordinator` runs it detached,
# and readiness is the `/health` probe below — the same block the tools dial.
