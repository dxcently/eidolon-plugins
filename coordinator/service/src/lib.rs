//! The coordination monitor's decisions, apart from its input and output.
//! Everything that decides anything lives here, and every input it decides on is
//! an argument, so the occurrence dedup, the notice lifecycle and the release
//! rules are testable without a harness, a roster or a send. `main.rs` is the
//! part that has to talk to the outside: the roster, the transport, the clock,
//! the files and the loopback endpoint.
//!
//! Four things this file deliberately does NOT do:
//!
//! - It never guesses an occurrence. A halt is announced once per *occurrence*,
//!   and the occurrence is the harness's `outcome_at` — the journal record that
//!   ended that turn. A count of records would be the wrong evidence (a peer's
//!   mail advances it while the same ending stands, turning one halt into a
//!   notice per poll), and two identical consecutive endings get different ids.
//!   `outcome_at` is null today: null means *not established*, so nothing is
//!   announced and the reason is said.
//! - An `errored` ending may have no journal record at all — only the driver that
//!   ran the turn saw it. For that case the harness publishes the registration's
//!   *count* of unjournaled endings (`outcome_observed`, one per ending, so two
//!   identical ones are 1 and then 2) together with the registration instance
//!   (`started_ms`), because a registration's *name* is reused across a restart.
//!   The occurrence key is that triple; a count of zero, or no instance token, is
//!   *not established* and nothing is announced.
//! - It never claims more than the transport said. The harness types the outcome
//!   (`delivered`/`queued`/`partial`/`failed`/`refused`), and the monitor stores
//!   the word it was given and the transport's own bytes beside it.
//! - It never resumes anything. The monitor's only effect on the world is one
//!   `send` per notice, to the coordinator, about a worker.
//!
//! The durable store — atomic and flushed writes, a refusal instead of guessing
//! when a file exists but cannot be read, and one writer per store — is in
//! [`store`]. It is passed in rather than reached for, so a failure to persist can
//! be injected exactly where it matters: before the send, and before the ack.
