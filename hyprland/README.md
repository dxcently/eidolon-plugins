# hyprland

See and drive a Hyprland session: `hyprland_inspect` (monitors, workspaces, windows with
identity and geometry), `hyprland_screenshot` (a monitor, a workspace, or a window, handed
over as a picture), `hyprland_focus`, and the input verbs `hyprland_click`,
`hyprland_scroll`, `hyprland_type` and `hyprland_key`.

The plugin exists because a person driving a session through an agent needs the two halves
to be different kinds of act, and to be checkable: **observation never changes what is on
screen**, and **input is aimed at a window that was inspected a moment ago, re-checked
immediately before it happens, and refused if it is not the same window**. What is not
guaranteed is written in the answer of every call rather than left to be assumed — a
Hyprland input primitive takes no window to bind to, so the re-checks narrow the window of
opportunity and cannot close it.

## What it needs from the session

- Hyprland with a **Lua config provider** (`hyprctl status` prints `configProvider: lua`,
  Hyprland 0.56 here). Focus is the compositor's own dispatcher, called through
  `hyprctl dispatch '<lua>'` with the window re-resolved *inside* that same call. A
  session on the older hyprlang provider answers `configProvider: hyprlang`; the
  observation verbs still work and the focus/screenshot/input verbs say what they need.
- `hyprctl` — part of Hyprland.
- `grim` for the screenshots, `wlrctl` (pointer) and `wtype` (keyboard) for the input
  verbs. `nix build .#hyprland` (or `nix profile install <this repo>#hyprland`) puts all
  three in one profile; any distro package of the same three works just as well. A verb
  whose client is missing refuses by name rather than failing obscurely.
- Nothing else: no service, no port, no token, no daemon. Each input verb runs the client
  for one act and the client exits. A chord's modifiers are released **by name inside that
  same invocation** (`wtype -M ctrl … -m ctrl`), because the client does not reset the seat's
  modifier state on its way out — see the note in Limits.

## Prerequisites

```bash
hyprctl version                       # Hyprland is running in this environment
hyprctl status | grep configProvider  # lua (focus) — observation works either way
nix build .#hyprland                  # builds grim + wlrctl + wtype into ./result
```

To use the built package:

```bash
nix profile install .#hyprland        # or: nix build .#hyprland && export PATH="$PWD/result/bin:$PATH"
command -v grim wlrctl wtype          # all three answer with a path
```

An operator who enforces Hyprland's own permissions (`ecosystem.enforce_permissions = true`
in the config, which is **false** by default and false on the machine this was written for)
must allow the two clients they use, once, then restart Hyprland:

```lua
hl.permission(".*/grim", "screencopy", "allow")
```

## Install

```bash
eidolon plugins install dxcently/eidolon-plugins hyprland
eidolon plugins trust hyprland
```

Installing does not trust. `trust hyprland` is what answers the gate for this plugin's
verbs, and it is written in the permission store — the two commands above are the whole
install, and a person should be able to see them afterwards. The plugin ships no tools
that reach a secret, so there is nothing for `grant` to record. The verbs are:

```
hyprland_inspect      read_only
hyprland_screenshot   read_only
hyprland_focus        mutating
hyprland_click        mutating
hyprland_scroll       mutating
hyprland_type         mutating
hyprland_key          mutating
```

## Verify

The tools are checked against fixed compositor answers, with no session and no input
device involved — fake `hyprctl`, `grim`, `wlrctl` and `wtype` first on `PATH`, with
`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `DISPLAY` and `HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE` removed, so a test cannot
reach a live session. From a checkout of this repo:

```bash
t=$(mktemp -d)
HOME=$t XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$t/cfg XDG_STATE_HOME=$t/state XDG_DATA_HOME=$t/data \
  bash tests/hyprland/run.sh
```

Every case prints `ok <name>` and the last line is `ok   every case`. The cases cover the
refusals as much as the successes: a window that moved, died or had its address reused
between the inspection and the click; a target on a workspace nobody is showing (and the
same target pinned, or on a special workspace an output has open, which are on screen and
are not refused); typing at a window that is not focused; a missing button; an input client
that is not installed; a pointer that did not arrive; and the one invocation that must never
be constructed — a bare `pointer click`, which `wlrctl`'s own CLI turns into a left click.
The fake `wlrctl` fails the run if it ever sees one.

One case is about what the compositor itself answers rather than about the plugin's logic:
`visibility` reads nothing but `hyprland_inspect` and re-derives every record's visibility
from the monitors that inspection reported. It runs in the suite above and, unchanged, against
the session that is really running:

```bash
bash tests/hyprland/check-live.sh
```

That one is read-only — `hyprland_inspect` and the `hyprctl -j` calls behind it, no input
client, no capture, no dispatcher — and it copies the plugin into a throwaway config, so the
installed tree is neither used nor touched.

On a real session, read-only and safe to run:

```bash
eidolon run 'call hyprland_inspect with format json, then screenshot monitor <name> and tell me what is on it' --yolo
```

**Live input is not part of Verify.** The four mutating verbs move the pointer, type and
press keys in the operator's real session; a call is aimed at a window by address, so the
honest smoke test is a window the operator owns for the purpose (a scratch terminal on a
scratch workspace), with the exact commands agreed first. Until then, the mock suite is
what "verified" means here.

## Limits, in the answer of every call

- **A capture writes a file, which is why `hyprland_screenshot` is `mutating`.** The class is
  about the disk and not the screen: the caller names the path (default
  `/tmp/eidolon-hyprland/<target-slug>.png`, in a 0700 directory) and the PNG lands there,
  overwriting whatever is at that path — the reach `write` has. Nothing about the session
  changes, and the verb focuses nothing, switches nothing and injects nothing.
- **No atomic targeting, and the race is named rather than claimed closed.** I found no
  compositor primitive, in the interfaces examined, that takes a window and injects into it: the
  pointer verbs go through `wlrctl`'s virtual device and the keyboard verbs through `wtype`'s,
  and every check is a separate `hyprctl` read. That is an inventory of what was looked at — the
  dispatchers registered in the running binary, and those two clients' own CLIs — and not a
  proof that no such call exists anywhere. `wlrctl pointer click` sends a button event and the
  compositor decides what is under the pointer, so the guard below narrows the window of
  opportunity and cannot close it: between the last read and the event, a person can move the
  pointer, a window can move, an output can switch — the answer says exactly that every time.
- **Every press is guarded, and the guard reads the monitors too.** Before each input event —
  each press of a multi-click, and the scroll — the monitors, the windows and the pointer's
  position are read again, and the event is refused if the window is not the one inspected, is
  gone, is hidden, stopped accepting input, is on a workspace *no output is showing any more*,
  the point has fallen outside it, or the pointer is not where it was put. The monitors are the
  part a fingerprint cannot answer: a window's fingerprint carries its own workspace, so it does
  not change when the output showing it switches to another one, and without re-reading the
  monitors a click aimed at layout x,y would land on whatever that output is showing at x,y.
  A multi-click that is stopped part-way says how many presses went in, because "nothing
  happened" would be false.
- **What the guard does not cover, said plainly.** None of the interfaces examined answers
  "which window is under the pointer", so a window overlapping the target at the point — a
  floating window over it, for instance — is undetectable from here and the event goes to
  whichever the compositor picks. The keyboard verbs (`hyprland_type`, `hyprland_key`) are
  addressed by *focus*, not by coordinates, so their guard is the active window rather than the
  pointer: it catches a focus that has already moved by the time they look, and re-reads the
  target immediately before the keys — but a workspace switch, or any other change of focus
  after that check, can still send the keys to a different client, and the tool reports that
  afterwards instead of preventing it. They do not re-read the monitors at that last instant
  either; closing that is a separate change, not this one. `hyprland_focus` is the verb whose
  whole purpose is to switch, and it does so only when asked.
- **The pointer is moved by displacement.** `wlrctl pointer move <dx> <dy>` has no
  absolute form, so the cursor position is read, the difference sent, and the position read
  back — a pointer that did not arrive is a refusal, not a click somewhere else.
- **Typing is a check, not a lock.** The focused window is read before and after; a focus
  that moved mid-text is reported as an error, since part of the text may have gone
  elsewhere.
- **A chord releases its modifiers explicitly.** `hyprland_key` presses each modifier, sends the
  key, then releases each modifier by name (`wtype -M ctrl -k a -m ctrl`) inside the one client
  invocation. It is not left to the client's exit: `wtype`'s only modifier call is the one
  `-M`/`-m` asks for, and closing the virtual keyboard does not reset the seat's modifier state —
  so a `-M` with no `-m` leaves the modifier down, and the *next* pointer event, this plugin's own
  included, carries it. A live probe's event log shows exactly that: a click and a wheel sent after
  a `ctrl+a` chord both arrived with `BUTTON_CTRL` set.
- **A window capture is a crop of the visible desktop.** `grim -T` wants a foreign-toplevel
  identifier and no Hyprland address maps to one, so a window is captured as its rectangle:
  anything overlapping it appears as it does on screen.
- **`visible` means on a screen now, and it is derived — it is not the compositor's own field.**
  hyprctl's workspace records have no `visible` at all, and its per-window `visible` is about the
  window's own surface (`!hidden && mapped && …` upstream): a mapped, unhidden window on a
  workspace nobody is showing really answers `true`. So visibility is worked out from the
  monitors — a workspace is shown when it is an enabled output's active workspace or the special
  workspace that output has open, and a window is on screen when it is mapped, unhidden, and
  either on such a workspace or pinned to such an output. hyprctl's own value is reported beside
  it as `compositor_visible`, and every verb that aims at a window refuses a target that is not
  on a screen.
- **A hidden workspace cannot be captured at all** — a compositor renders only what is
  showing. The tool refuses and names `hyprland_focus`, which switches to it on purpose and
  says so, instead of switching silently.
- **Coordinates are logical layout coordinates** (the space `hyprctl`, `grim -g` and the
  input clients share). Every rect is reported beside its monitor's `scale` and `transform`,
  because the picture's *pixels* are the rect times the scale, rotated when transform is 1
  or 3.
- **No window management.** No close, no kill, no move, no resize, no layout: this plugin
  observes, focuses, captures, clicks, scrolls, types and presses keys, and nothing else.

## Uninstall

```bash
eidolon plugins uninstall hyprland
```

The directory and its row in the record go; the vouch written by `trust` is left alone
(a reinstall inherits it). Nothing else was installed: no service, no token file, no
`config.toml` change. If the runtime package was installed with `nix profile`, remove it
the same way:

```bash
nix profile remove hyprland
```
